## The Structure of StarLifter

A **Dashboard** is a group of charts and KPIs created from a table of data. 

Tables of data are called **Collections**.

Collections are grouped together into **Domains** based on contents of the collections, an integration, or to simplify data sharing.  

An **Organization** comprises all domains of data.  While users may have access to multiple organizations, data is not shared between organizations.
